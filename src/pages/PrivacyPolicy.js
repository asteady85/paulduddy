          <h3>General Data Protection Regulations</h3>
          <p>Paul Duddy Vehicle Sales and Finance handles data supplied by its customers for the application of finance. We are registered with the Information Commissioner's Office under registration reference Z9932607 and the register is available at www.ico.org.uk.</p>
          <p>This document outlines Paul Duddy Vehicle Sales and Finance policy.</p>
          <p>For the purposes of handling your data Vehicle Consulting UK Limited is both a Data Controller and Data Processor.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A controller determines the purposes and means of processing personal data.</li>
            <li>A processor is responsible for processing personal data on behalf of a controller.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This is a living document and we are working to expand it in key areas.</p>

          <h3>What information does the GDPR apply to?</h3>
          <p>The GDPR applies to 'personal data' meaning any information relating to an identifiable person who can be directly or indirectly identified in particular reference to an identifier.</p>
          <p>This definition provides a wide range of personal identifiers to constitute personal data, including name, identification number, location data or online identifier.</p>
          <p>The GDPR applies to both automated personal data and to manual filing systems where personal data are accessible according to specific criteria. This could include chronologically ordered sets of manual records containing personal data.</p>

          <h3>Our commitment to you under GDPR?</h3>
          <p>Your data will be processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to individuals, including directors, partners and proprietors.</p>
          <p>Your data will only be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.</p>
          <p>We will only collect data which is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.</p>
          <p>We will ensure the data will be accurate (to the best of our capability) and, where necessary, kept up to date. Every reasonable step will be taken to ensure that personal data inaccuracies are erased or rectified without delay.</p>
          <p>Your data will be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes.</p>
          <p>Your data will be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.</p>
          <p>Your data will only be retained for as long as necessary.</p>
          <p>We will be able to demonstrate compliance with these principles.</p>


          <h3>Consent</h3>
          <p>Paul Duddy Vehicle Sales and Finance requires consent from customer(s) to use your data for the purposes which have been agreed.</p>

          <h3>Collecting Personal Data</h3>
          <p>We can collect your personal data when you: -</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Receive special offers</li>
            <li>Ask us for more information about a product or service</li>
            <li>Contact us with a specific question</li>
            <li>Buy a product or service from us (including online, over the phone or face to face)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There are different stages to the levels of personal data we need to collect, use and store. Paul Duddy Vehicle Sales and Finance are committed to only use personal data for the purposes for which it has been provided and for a length of time deemed appropriate.  For full details of our General Data Protection Regulations policy, please see additional tab on the Web Page.</p>
          <p>Any personal data we collect from you will not be transferred outside of the European Economic Area.</p>
          <p>For training purposes, we will monitor, record, store and use any telephone and/or email communications with you.</p>

          <h3>Enquiries</h3>
          <p>Enquiries received by (including but not limited too) telephone/referral/electronically will be placed on our electronic Sales Management System. We will require the following information for the purposes of providing quotations: -</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Name and address</li>
            <li>Email address</li>
            <li>Telephone number - mobile or landline</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The information will only be used for the purposes of providing quotations, as requested.  The information will not be passed to any 3rd party provider, and no credit search will be undertaken.</p>

          <h3>Finance Application</h3>
          <p>As a Data Processor, once (and only when) you have completed an application for finance, we will carefully process your data with a carefully selected panel of funders.  The application for finance will only be processed with one finance provider.  If there is a requirement to move to a different funder, we will receive permission from the customer.</p>
          <p>It is important that you understand how our different funding partners use 'Your Information' in connection with your application.  'Your Information' means the information you have given us, which we pass on to them, or which they receive from their enquiries and searches as credit reference and fraud prevention agencies.  This applies to all applicants, including joint applications and members of the household, and directors or partners if the application is made by a limited company, partnership or unincorporated association.</p>
          <p>They'll check your details with credit reference and fraud prevention agencies, who will record the check.  They will provide the agencies with your current and previous names, addresses and dates of birth of all parties as well as the income and expenditure details that you have provided; so, if you are providing information about others on a joint application, you must be sure that you have their agreement.  The agencies will provide them with confirmation of the income and expenditure details provided and public information about you and any third party financially linked to you: information such as county court judgements (CCJs) and bankruptcies, electoral register and fraud prevention on you and your known financial associates, current and previous names, addresses and dates of birth.  If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified, details will be passed to fraud prevention agencies.  Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information.</p>


          <h3>Credit Check</h3>
          <p>The agency searches that they make will leave a search footprint, both in their records and on your credit file at the agencies they've used, whether or not the application proceeds.  If the search was for a credit application, the record of that search (but not their name) may be seen by other organisations when you apply for credit in the future.  If you have made a joint application, they will link together the records of joint applicants, called financial associates.  They will also link all your previous and subsequent names and addresses.  Links between financial associates will remain on your and their files until such time as you or your associate successfully files for a disassociation with the credit reference agencies.  It may be necessary to make more than one such search particularly if you provide new or changed information.  If your finance application proceeds in excess of 90 days after the initial application, then it will be necessary for an additional credit reference agency search to be undertaken.</p>
          <p>Information provided may be supplied to other organisations and used by agencies and them to assess you and your household for: credit and credit related services, affordability of credit; motor, household, credit, life and other insurance proposals and claims; debt tracing and recovery; checking details of job applicants and employees, prevention of fraud and money laundering; managing your accounts; statistical analysis about credit, insurance and fraud; market research, and to verify your identity if you or your financial associate applies for other facilities, including all types of insurance applications and claims.  They and other organisations may access and use the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies from other countries.  Information about you may also be used for other purposes for which you have given consent, or, in very limited circumstances, when required by law or where permitted under the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998.  Credit scoring and profiling techniques will be used to assess your application.</p>
          <p>Credit reference agencies used include Experian, Equifax and others from time to time.</p>
          <p>A copy of our personal finance proposal is available upon request and the following is a summary of the information we will require for the finance application of a private individual to be processed:</p>
