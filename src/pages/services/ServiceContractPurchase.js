        A Funding Agreement where title to the vehicle passes to the customer when all payments and fees have been paid.<br />
        Agreements are constructed with a deferred payment equating to the anticipated value of the vehicle at the end of the agreement. The future value of the vehicle is guaranteed based upon the mileage, so after the agreed term you have the option of:

        <li>Purchasing the vehicle at the pre agreed Optional Purchase Payment. </li>
        <li>Part Exchange for another vehicle. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The contract is set for a period usually between 2 &amp; 4 years.</p>
      <p>The customer pays a fixed monthly payment which will always include benefits such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cost of vehicle funding.</li>
        <li>Cost of vehicle depreciation.</li>
        <li>Low initial outlay.</li>
        <li>Low monthly cost.</li>
        <li>No risk for depreciation.</li>
        <li>No VAT on finance repayment.</li>
        <li>Option to own vehicle.</li>
        <li>Vehicle appears on balance sheet.</li>
